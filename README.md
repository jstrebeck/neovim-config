**My personal Neovim config based on NvChad**
- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.

# Plugins 
- Plugins are managed in the `lua/plugins/init.lua` file
    - To install them use the `:Lazy sync` command
- These are the plugins used in this config on top of the existing NvChad base plugins
    - MarkdownPreview
    - Lazygit
    - Treesitter
        - Python
        - Terraform
        - HCL
